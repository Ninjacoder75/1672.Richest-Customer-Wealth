The given code defines a Java class `Solution` that contains a method `maximumWealth`. This method calculates the maximum wealth of a customer, where each customer has multiple bank accounts. The wealth of a customer is the sum of money in all their accounts, and the method is designed to return the maximum wealth among all customers.

- `accounts` is a 2D array, where each row represents a customer, and each column represents the amount of money in a particular account for that customer.
- The outer loop iterates over each customer (`i`), and the inner loop calculates the total wealth of that customer by summing all the account values (`j`).
- The method keeps track of the maximum wealth using the variable `ans`, updating it whenever a customer's wealth exceeds the current maximum.
- Finally, the method returns the maximum wealth.

# Code Implementation
class Solution {
    public int maximumWealth(int[][] accounts) {
       int ans=0;
       int m =accounts.length;
       int n = accounts[0].length;
        for(int i=0;i<m;i++){
        int  sum=0;
            for(int j=0;j<n;j++){

                sum = sum + accounts[i][j];
            }
            ans = Math.max(sum,ans);
            
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
